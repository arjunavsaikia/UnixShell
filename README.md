The "echo" command prints what we write as it is.
The type command is used to check wheather a command is "builtin" or some executable from the path environment variables.

Here I am showing the current working directory using the "pwd" command.
I am changing the directory using the "cd" command.
Executing a program "ls" that is in the path environment variable.
